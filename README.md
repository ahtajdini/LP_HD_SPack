# Linear Programming Bound on Sphere Packing 
This repository included Julia and Mathematica code for calculating the upper bound on the packing density of spheres in different dimensions. This is based on a paper that my collaborators and I published for the papers cited in references.

## Quick Introduction
Sphere packing is an old problem in discrete geometry with a rich history. The problem is seeking to maximize the fraction of $\mathrm{R}^{D}$ covered with non-overlapping spheres. Some applications of sphere packing are in communication theory, error correcting codes, toy models of granular material, modular forms, and even biology. Despite how simple the problem's statement is, it is a notoriously hard problem to solve. The only dimensions that the sphere packing has been solved are just $D=1,2,3,8,24$. The solution for two dimension $D=2$ is the Hexagonal lattice and was rigorously proved in 1942 by Toth. $D=3$ is the famous Kepler conjecture. Being asked about the optimal arrangement of cannonballs, Kepler conjectured that a a family of lattices consists of fcc and hpc lattices are the optimal packing in three dimensions. The Kepler conjecture was proved three centuries later by Thomas Hales in 1998. The solutions in  $D=8, 24$ correspond to well-known $E_8$ and Leech lattice respectively.
