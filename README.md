# Linear Programming Bound on Sphere Packing 
This repository included Julia and Mathematica code for calculating the upper bound on the packing density of spheres in different dimensions. This is based on a paper that my collaborators and I published for the papers cited in references.

## Quick Introduction
Sphere packing is an old problem in discrete geometry. The problem is seeking to maximize the fraction of $\mathbb{R}^{D}$ with non-overlapping spheres.
