# Linear Programming Bound on Sphere Packing 
This repository included Julia and Mathematica code for calculating the upper bound on the packing density of spheres in different dimensions. This is based on a paper that my collaborators and I published for the papers cited in references.

## Quick Introduction
Sphere packing is an old problem in discrete geometry. The problem is seeking to maximize the fraction of $\mathrm{R}^{D}$ covered with non-overlapping spheres. Some applications of sphere packing are in communication theory, error correcting codes, toy models of granular material, and modular forms. Despite how simple the problem's statement is, it is a notoriously hard problem to solve. The only dimensions that the sphere packing has been solved are just $D=1,2,3,8,24$. The
