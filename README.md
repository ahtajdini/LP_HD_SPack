# Linear Programming Bound on Sphere Packing 
This repository included Julia and Mathematica code for calculating the upper bound on the packing density of spheres in different dimensions $D$. I used the similar code here to obtain the best known linear programming bound on packing density in high dimensions, $D \sim 1-2000$. The work is based on a paper that my collaborators and I published cited in references.
